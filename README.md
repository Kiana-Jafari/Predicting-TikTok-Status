# Predicting-TikTok-Status

TikTok videos receive a large number of user reports for many different reasons. Not all reported videos can undergo review by a human moderator.
Videos that make claims (as opposed to opinions) are much more likely to contain content that violates the platformâ€™s terms of service. TikTok seeks a way to identify videos that make claims to prioritize them for review.
The data team built two tree-based classification models. Both models were used to predict on a held-out validation dataset, and final model selection was determined by the model with the best recall score. The final model was then used to score a test dataset to estimate future performance.
In this senario, I was tasked to create machine learning model for the claims classification data. Also, I was responsible for leading these final tasks, which include feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
